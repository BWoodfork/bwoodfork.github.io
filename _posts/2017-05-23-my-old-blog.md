Hey! So, I began this blog to branch off of my old blog. 2 years ago, I stopped
updating my old blog as it was something that I was contributing to during my apprenticeship
at 8th Light. Because I wanted to move my blog from Wordpress to Jekyll and because
I wanted to keep my old content separate from my new content, I created the blog
that you see now! So the blogs on this site will be my latest.

However, if you want to read my old blog, you still can!
