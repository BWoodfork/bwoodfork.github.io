This past week, I gave a talk at [AlterConf](http://alterconf.com/) in Portland.
The title of the talk was, the truth about mentoring minorities. It was my first rendition
of this talk. That said, there are some things that I will be changing. This will include
some additions and substractions that I feel will help strengthen the point that I am looking
to make when I give it.
