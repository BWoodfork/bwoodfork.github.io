      <description>I wanted to blog a bit about what some of my accomplishments and learnings were in 2018. So here we go!
Took a break from speaking at conferences
Iâ€™d decided to take a break from speaking at multiple conferences in 2018. I wanted to focus more on growing my professional skills, mentoring and starting my meetup.

      <description>Before we dig into this topic. I want to make it clear that these are my personal views on what I look for when hiring an apprentice or reaching out to a potential candidate. These views may not reflect those of every employee at the company (8th Light). As an aside, I use the term &amp;ldquo;Software Crafter&amp;rdquo; often as it is the term my company uses to refer to its developers.</description>
